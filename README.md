# 🌱 Spring Core Learning Project

This is a self-learning project created to explore and understand the **core concepts of the Spring Framework**. It focuses on mastering the fundamentals such as **Inversion of Control (IoC)**, **Dependency Injection (DI)**, and various configuration styles (XML and Java-based).

---

## 📘 What I Learned

This project includes practical examples and exercises for:

- ✅ **IoC (Inversion of Control)**  
  Understanding how control is transferred from application code to the Spring container.

- ✅ **DI (Dependency Injection)**  
  Injecting dependencies through constructors, setters, and autowiring.

- ✅ **Bean Life Cycle Methods**  
  Using `init-method`, `destroy-method`, `@PostConstruct`, and `@PreDestroy`.

- ✅ **Spring Bean Configuration**
    - Using **XML-based configuration**
    - Using **Java-based configuration** with `@Configuration` and `@Bean`

- ✅ **Autowiring**
    - By type and by name
    - Using `@Autowired` annotation

- ✅ **Injecting Collections**
    - List, Set, Map, and Properties injection via XML and annotations
